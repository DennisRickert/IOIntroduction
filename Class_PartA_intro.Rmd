## 

***Brilliant minds expressed their scepticism regarding statistics***

- **There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics** (popularized by Mark Twain)
- **The only statistics you can trust are those you falsified yourself** (attributed to Whinston Churchill)
<br>

One reason may lie in the abuse of statistics...

- **Torture the data until it confesses** (Mancur Olson)
<br>

... another in the difficulty of using statistics appropriately

- **The economy is a miserable experimental design** (R. E. Lucas)

In this class, we learn the proper use of statistics in economics

## What is improper use of statistics? 

Indeed, we all do honest mistakes due to 

- time pressure (deadlines for bachelor, master, PhD) 
- loosing track in the **garden of forking paths** (A. Gelman)

Sometimes there are illegitimate attempts for fame  

- **p-hacking**: torturing the data until we get the result we want 
- **HARKing**: making your ***H***ypothesis ***A***fter ***R***esult ***K***nown 
- **fraud**: faking the data

... potentially caused by publication bias or biased employer 

## This led to replication crisis: psychology

Only 23-33% of studies in leading Psychology journal replicated:

- [Group Author: Open Science Collaboration](https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/jq7v6/?action=download%26mode=render>)
- [Link to article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.17433)


Standard theory of social priming not at all reproducible:

- Students exposed to senior-connotated words walk slower, warm coffee makes people feel warmer towards others, people exposed to the word money are more selfish, etc
- Some claim that none of the studies in Kahnemann's thinking fast and slow would replicate (e.g., framing)
- [Link to article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03755-2)

## This led to replication crisis: medicine

Only 11-30% of cancer studies could be replicated:

J. Ioannidis' drastic conclusion: Most Clinical Research Not Useful

- [Why Most Clinical Research Is Not Useful](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002049)


## This led to replication crisis: economics

60-70% of studies in major journals could be replicated:

- [Link 1 to article in Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/1433)
- [Link 2 to article in Science](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/about-40-economics-experiments-fail-replication-survey)

Why is that?

- Combining economic theory, rigorous econometrics, and good data? Aka Structural Econometrics?
- Using Stata, Python, and R for reproducible research? 
- You will both learn in this class!

## Learning objectives of Session 3+4 Part A

- Understand how to use GitHub, R, and RStudio 
  - for reproducible research 
  - with transparent path to final results
  - using version control for error management  
-   Become confident to use them (no rocket science!)
-   Understand why we need econometrics: to have causal effects instead
    of (potentially spurious) simple correlations
-   Revisit the standard tools of econometrics: OLS, 2SLS
-   Apply linear regressions in R without and with endogeneity

# Introduction into R and RStudio

## Impressive growth of R

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("growth_r.png")
```

<https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/>

## Some basics in R...

To be able to use R, we need to understand:

-   Surface of R and RStudio
-   Packages
-   Data (frames, import, export, missings)
-   Summary statistics and graphs

... which we learn in this class.


## Before using R and RStudio

R is a free software (GNU license)

- from: <http://www.r-project.org>

works best in combination with RStudio

- from: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop>

Sign up for Github (for version control): <https://github.com/>

- and download Github desktop: <https://desktop.github.com/>

## Useful links

Some introductory classes: Using R for Introductory Econometrics: -
<http://www.urfie.net/>

If you need help:

-   Search engine: keyword + rstats
-   Forums:
    -   <http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/R>
    -   <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r>

## Github for content + version control

Once you have installed everything, and signed up for the necessary:

-   Go to <https://github.com/DennisRickert/IOIntroduction>,
    -   click on 'fork', then 'fork' again.
    -   then 'code', then 'Open with Github desktop'
-   Open RStudio on your computer, click on 'new project', then browse
    to the folder that you just cloned the git repo into in Windows
-   probably: C:/Users/Username/Documents/GitHub/IOIntroduction

## Save your work in github

In RStudio, once you have opened your project:

-   Click on 'file', 'new file', 'Rmarkdown', 'PDF', and save it
    ('tutorial1')
-   Click on 'knit'
-   RMarkdown is a great way to have your report text and econometrics
    code in the same file

## Trying out Git

In RStudio:

-   Head over to git on the top right hand side, select files you'd like
    to commit, click 'commit', add a message (e.g. 'first commit'), and
    then click 'commit', then 'push'
-   Git is a version control system that you can use to roll back to any
    version of your work
-   Commit frequently
-   You may want to add a branch, perhaps called 'local', so that you
    are not working on the 'master' (production) version You can have a
    look at your latest commit and push on github.com

## Surface of RStudio (using R)

The surface of RStudio consists of four windows

-   Script file (upper left)
    -   write reproducible code
-   Console (lower left)
    -   output is shown
-   Work space (upper right): environment, history, ...
    -   mainly shows your variables and data
-   Auxiliary (lower right): files, plots, packages, ...
    -   nice help function but otw rarely used

## Screenshot of surface of R Studio

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "105%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rstudio_surface.jpg")
```

## Console = similar to calculator:

Simple operations

```{r , echo=t}
2+4
5*3
3^4
```

## Console = similar to calculator:

creating a vector of 1 row and 5 columns.

```{r , echo=t}
c(1,2,3,4,5)
rbind(1:5)
```

## Console = similar to calculator:

creating a vector of 5 rows and 1 column

```{r , echo=t}
cbind(1:5)
```

## Console = similar to calculator:

creating matrices. Alternative is function matrix()

```{r , echo=t}
cbind(1:5,1:5)
rbind(1:5,1:5)
```

## Practical Excercise

1/ Type in calculator operations in console

## Functions

| Command    | Description                             |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| sqrt(x)    | square root of value x                  |
| abs(x)     | absolute value of x                     |
| exp(x)     | exponential of x                        |
| log(x)     | natural logarithm of ln(x)              |
| round(x,s) | round x to s digits after decimal point |

## Practical Excercise

2/ Type in functions with x=5.34, s=1 in console

# R scripts

## However, we prefer to use R scripts:

-   Do not type commands in console, collect in them in R-scripts
-   R-scripts: text file with file extension: .R
-   Advantages:
    -   Transparency
    -   Documentation
    -   Easy to correct mistakes
    -   Reproducibility
    -   You can run the code with one click when data changes

## Working with R scripts

-   You can run scripts all at once, line-by-line, or in sections
    -   Mouse click: -\> run (all or selection)
    -   Menu: code -\> run (all or selection)
    -   ctrl + enter (all or selection)
-   You should comment the scripts.
    -   Each line starting with \# will be ignored by R
    -   Helps for documentation and to remember why you did what (for
        yourself and others)

```{r , echo=t}
# This is a comment for 3*8
3*8
```

## Practical Excercise

3/ Create new R script

-   File -\> New File -\> R Script
-   ctrl + shift + n

# Variables

## Variables: what are they?

-   Variables are similar to objects in other programs
-   Variables can be populated with a variety of content, e.g.,
    -   Numbers
    -   Vectors
    -   Matrices
    -   Data sets
    -   Results from econometric estimations
    -   ...

## Variables: create + operate

Create a new variable by assigning a value to it using "\<-"

```{r , echo=t}
# Create vector x from 1 to 5 without printing 
x <- c(1:5)
```

Operate with variables

```{r , echo=t}
# Create vector y = x+2
y <- x + 2

# Print y
y
```

-   RStudio shows the variable in the "Environment" panel.
-   Print variable: type variable name and hit enter.

## Special functions for variables

| Command   | Description                                        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| x[i]      | i-th value within vector x                         |
| length(x) | length of vector x (number of elements)            |
| min(x)    | minimum of vector x (smallest element)             |
| max(x)    | maximum of vector x (largest element)              |
| sum(x)    | sum of elements in vector x                        |
| mean(x)   | mean of elements in vector x                       |
| sort(x)   | sort elements in vector x (from lowest to largest) |
| t(x)      | transpose vector x (exchange columns and rows)     |

## Functions also work with vector x

```{r , echo=t}
# Create vector x from 1 to 5. 
x <- c(1:5)

# Show output of square root of x
sqrt(x)
```

Similarly, we can type:

-   abs(x)\
-   exp(x)\
-   log(x)\
-   round(x,s)

# Data

## Create data (using data.frame)

-   Data: collection of **vectors** into columns and rows
    -   just like matrices and tables
-   **Vectors** often are our variables c();
    -   the first row is the variable name x1,x2, ...
-   Function data.frame(x1,x2,...)
    -   creates a data set consisting of vectors x1,x2,...
-   Extract vector x1 from data frame df
    -   e.g., df\$x1


## Create data: Application

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# create fake vectors
year <- c(2001:2010)
revenues <- sample.int(100, 10)
costs <- sample.int(10, 10)

# gather fake vectors in data frame
my_df <- data.frame(year,revenues,costs)

# save data
save(my_df, file="~/my_df.Rdata")

# view data
my_df
```

## Create data: Application contd.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# extract vector / variable name from data frame
my_df$revenues

# simulate new revenue and store as new variable
new_revenue = 5 + my_df$revenues
new_revenue

# add variable to data frame
my_df$new_revenue <- new_revenue 

# add variable directly to data frame
my_df$profit <- my_df$revenues - my_df$cost
```


## Useful functions for data frames (df)

| Command   | Description                              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| names(df) | variable names                           |
| nrow(df)  | number of rows (i.e., observations)      |
| ncol(df)  | number of columns (i.e., variable names) |
| head(df)  | first 6 rows of data frame               |
| tail(df)  | last 6 rows of data frame                |

## Brief digression: Packages

We use the package ***rio*** to import data

- Packages extend the functionality of R
- To use the package ***rio*** (or others):
  - Download once per computer by install.packages("rio")
  - Activate once per session and script using library("rio")

We will also need the various other packages in “0 starthere.R”, so please install and load them.

## Import data

-   R can import several types of data sets: xls, csv, txt, .dta, ...
-   ***rio*** can detect the data type automatically
-   We use the command import from the package ***rio***

```{r,echo=TRUE}
# import data set using command import from package rio 
# install.packages("rio") if needed
library("rio")
df <- import("~/my_df.Rdata")
```


## Practical Excercise

5/ Import data and store in data frame df

## Missing Data (na = no available)

-   mean(x1, na.rm=true)
    -   drop missing values from calculation of mean
-   is.na(x1)
    -   Check if missing values (na) exist in your data
-   na.omit(df)
    -   Create new data frame with all missing values (na) omitted

# Graphs

## Graphs

<blockquote>

***"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst's
mind than any other device***" John Tukey

<blockquote>

<br>

-   Graphs are the most important tool for data analysis!!!
-   We use ggplot2, with gg standing for "grammar of graphics"
-   This shows the philosophy of the package
-   Google, Microsoft, New York Times create graphs like this
-   Cheatsheet:
    -   Help -\> Cheatsheets -\> Data visualization with ggplot2

## Structure of the command ggplot

-   Create new graph by using ggplot()
-   Geometrical objects ("Geoms") added using symbol "+"
-   Each graph consists of geometrical objects (Geoms)
    -   Lines: geom_line()
    -   Dots: geom_point()
    -   ... (see "Cheatsheet")
-   Each Geom requires
    -   A dataset containing our variables of interest
    -   A mapping of the variables with the graphical elements
        (aesthetics)
        -   x: x-axis
        -   y: y-axis

## Example Graph

```{r, echo=t, fig.height=2.5,fig.width=4}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data=my_df,
            mapping=aes(x=year, y=revenues))
```

Revenues of the `r nrow(my_df)` years from `r min(my_df$year)` through
`r max(my_df$year)` lie between `r min(my_df$revenue)` and
`r max(my_df$revenue)` with an average of `r mean(my_df$revenue)`

## Practical Excercise

7/ Create graph using df
