# Session 3+4 - Part B: Causality using economic and empirical models


## What we do in Session 3+4 - Part B

- Intuitive examples of causality vs correlation
- Understanding the causal effect of price on demand
- Apply economic + empirical models for causal reasoning


## Clearly there are some strange studies

Some examples of real research questions (and results) are

- Winning a nobel price by eating more chocolate?
- Do storks deliver babies?

<br>
Other examples are

- More likely to drown after eating ice cream?
- Does Internet Explorer cause murders?

## Eating chocolate to get Nobel price?
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("choc1.png")
```

## Graphical support for the hypothesis
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("choc2.png")
```

## NEJM is a leading prestige journal 
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("nejm.png")
```

## Do storks deliver babies?
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("storks.png")
```

## Positive relationship between the two
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("stork1.png")
```

## What is potentially driving the results? 
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("stork2.png")
```

## Do you drown after eating ice cream?
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("IceCreamDrowning.png")
```


## Internet explorer causes murder?
```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("explorer.png")
```

## Why these examples?

These examples are useful to 

- Understand difference between causality and correlation
- Being able to spot omitted variable bias

<br>

Never blindly trust a simple relationship between two variables 

- example: economic relation between price and demand
- using a simple simulated exercise in R 

# Understanding the effect of price on demand

## Bob’s Ice Cream Business

Bob bought a small ice cream truck from Emma 

- Emma left Bob a collection of data, where for each day $t$
  - the price $p_{t}$ she had set
  - the number of ice cream portions $q_{t}$ she had sold
  - the wholesale cost $c_{t}$ for buying a big box of ice cream

<br>

As a young consultant you help Bob to optimize his business. 

- How would you proceed to find an optimal pricing rule?

## 

As a consultant you of course have put Emma's data into an excel spreadsheet. We load it as follows: 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages("rio")
library("rio")

# import data set using command import from package rio
ice_cream_sales <- import("ice cream sales.csv")

# First have a look at the data, with: Alternative: str(ice_cream_sales)
head(ice_cream_sales)

```

## Summarize the data

```{r,echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}

range(ice_cream_sales$t)

range(ice_cream_sales$c)

range(ice_cream_sales$p)

range(ice_cream_sales$q)

```


## Intuitive relationship between $p$ and $q$?

As a consultant you know the power of graphs, so you type:

```{r,echo=TRUE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
plot(p ~ q, data = ice_cream_sales)
```
Was Emma setting profit-maximizing prices?

## Some explanations 

Unobserved factors (demand shocks) affect both demand and price, which might generate the positive relationship

- Seasonality (summer vs winter) likely affects demand
- Demand is high in summer and low in winter 

Price may react in response to demand shocks, e.g., 

- Prices increase with high demand in summmer
- Prices decrease with low demand in winter

Other examples

- Advertising may increase demand
- Better quality increase demand

# The economic model behind omitted variables

## A simple economic theory model 

In principle, we can well imagine to have

- a downward-sloping demand function (in price $p$), 
  - with random demand shocks (e.g., due to seasonality)
- and firms which set profit-maximizing prices

and still find a positive relationship between prices and output.

<br>

We now present a simple model of the data generating process

## We first specify the demand function $q$

Demand in period $t$ is given by the following function 

$$q_{t}=a_{t}-bp_{t}$$

- $b>0$: parameter measuring how $q$ changes with $p$
- $a$ measures how high demand would be at price 0

The market size parameter $a_{t}$ is given by 
$$a_{t}=a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}$$

- $a_{0}>0$ is a constant (some people always buy ice cream)
- $\varepsilon_{t}$ is a random “demand shock” in period $t$ (not affected by $p$).
  - Good weather: -> positive $\varepsilon$
  - Bad weather: -> negative $\varepsilon$

## How do firms set profit-maximizing $p$?

The firm’s profits are given by 

$$\pi_{t}=p_{t}q_{t}-c_{t}q_{t} - F$$

- $c_{t}\geq0$ is a constant marginal cost of production in period $t$ (cost of one portion of ice cream)
- $F$ are some fixed costs that don't depend on the price.
- We already know that: $q_{t}=a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}-bp_{t}$

A firm chooses a price $p_{t}$ that maximizes its profits knowing

- its cost $c_{t}$, 
- the demand shock $\varepsilon_{t}$
- the parameters $a_{0}$ and $b$

## Optimal prices and output

We find optimal prices and quantities are given by: 

$$p^*_{t} = \frac{a_0+\varepsilon_t}{2b}+\frac{c_{t}}{2}$$ 
$$q^*_{t} = \frac{a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}}{2}-\frac{b c_{t}}{2}$$

which both depend on $a_t=a_0+\epsilon_t$ 

(Show this by taking the derivative of profits w.r.t. price $\frac{\partial \Pi_t}{\partial p_t}$)

## Proof  (to look at home)

Plug in demand function into profits

$$\begin{align*}
\pi(p_t) & = q_t(p_t)(p-c_{t}) - F\\
 & =(a_{t}-bp_t)(p_t-c_{t}) - F\\
 & =a_{t}p-a_{t}c_t-bp_t^{2}+bp_t c_{t} - F
\end{align*}$$

The first order condition is given by

$$\frac{\partial \pi(p_t)}{\partial p_t} = a_t-2bp_t+b c_t = 0$$

Solving for price $p$

$$p_t = \frac{a_{t}}{2b}+\frac{c_{t}}{2}$$

## Proof (to look at home)

If we plug in $a_t=a_0+\varepsilon_t$, we get
$$\begin{align*}
p^*_{t} & =\frac{a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}}{2b}+\frac{c_{t}}{2}
\end{align*}$$

Plug this expression into $q$ to get the equilibrium quantity

$$\begin{align*}
q^*_{t} & = a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t} - b p_t^* \\
        & = \frac{a_{0}+\varepsilon_{t}}{2}-\frac{b c_{t}}{2}
\end{align*}$$


## Simulating the model in R

- To get intuition about this economic model, we want to simulate in R.
- Here and in other places I will show you some R code in the class and the steps are roughly described in the slides.
- You will repeat similar steps in more detail in the corresponding RTutor problem sets.
  - For that reason you won't get all the R code from class. Look at the RTutor problem set instead.

## Define our model

```{r,echo=TRUE}
T = 10 # number of days
a0 = 100 # market size parameter
b = 1
c = runif(T,min = 10, max = 20)
  
sigma.eps = 10 # standard deviation sigma of demand shocks
eps = rnorm(n = T, mean = 0, sd = sigma.eps)

# equation for optimal prices
p = (a0 + eps)/(2*b)  + c / 2

# demand function
q = a0 + eps - b*p
```

## Plot the graph

What do you see? What is the problem with this graph?

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(x=p,y=q)
```


## Why this positive relation? 

Indeed we have a positive relationship between $p$ and $q$ 

- although demand is downward sloping due to $b=1$ 
- $b=1$ enters negatively into the demand function

<br>

The reason is the omitted variable bias

- positive epsilons increase both the $p$ and the $q$ 
- while negative epsilons decrease both the $p$ and the $q$. 
- We omit a relevant variable affecting $p$ and the $q$  

Think also of the examples of chocolate, storks, drowning 

## Next steps 

Increase $T$ from $T=10 to $T=1000$

- How does the relationship change between $p$ and $q$?

<br>

Decrease epsilon to 0.0001.

- How does the relationship change between $p$ and $q$?

<br>

Replace optimal prices $p$ with randomized prices

- How does the relationship change between $p$ and $q$?


## Increase number of observations

```{r,echo=TRUE}
T = 1000 # number of days
a0 = 100 # market size parameter
b = 1
c = runif(T,min = 10, max = 20)
  
sigma.eps = 10 # standard deviation sigma of demand shocks
eps = rnorm(n = T, mean = 0, sd = sigma.eps)

# equation for optimal prices
p = (a0 + eps)/(2*b)  + c / 2

# demand function
q = a0 + eps - b*p
```

## Plot the graph with more observations

What do you see? Is there still a problem?

```{r,echo=TRUE}
plot(x=p,y=q)
```

## Decrease the demand shock epsilon

```{r,echo=TRUE}
T = 1000 # number of days
a0 = 100 # market size parameter
b = 1
c = runif(T,min = 10, max = 20)
  
sigma.eps = 0.0001 # standard deviation sigma of demand shocks
eps = rnorm(n = T, mean = 0, sd = sigma.eps)

# equation for optimal prices
p = (a0 + eps)/(2*b)  + c / 2

# demand function
q = a0 + eps - b*p
```

## Plot the graph with low epsilon

What do you see? What is the slope of this graph?

```{r}
plot(x=p,y=q)
```

## Replace the p by random values

```{r,echo=TRUE}
T = 1000 # number of days
a0 = 100 # market size parameter
b = 1
c = runif(T,min = 10, max = 20)
  
sigma.eps = 5 # standard deviation sigma of demand shocks
eps = rnorm(n = T, mean = 0, sd = sigma.eps)

# equation for optimal prices
#p = (a0 + eps)/(2*b)  + c / 2

# randomized p
p = runif(n=T,min = 30,max = 50)

# demand function
q = a0 + eps - b*p
```

## Plot the graph with random $p$

What do you see? 

```{r}
plot(x=p,y=q)
```

## Next steps 

Estimate the slope of the demand function using lm()

- Are the slope in line with the previous graphs?

## Estimating the demand function

Next we want to estimate this linear relationship 

- Use the R function lm (stands for linear model) to estimate the following linear regression model of the demand function 

$$\begin{align*}
q_{t}=&\beta_{0}&+&\beta_{1}p_{t}&+\varepsilon_{t} \\
     (=& a_0   &+& (-b)p_t & +\varepsilon_{t})    
\end{align*}$$

<br> 

where $p$ can be different functions, such as 

- optimal prices
- random prices

## Go back to model with high epsilon
```{r,echo=TRUE}
T = 1000 # number of days
a0 = 100 # market size parameter
b = 1
c = runif(T,min = 10, max = 20)
  
sigma.eps = 10 # standard deviation sigma of demand shocks
eps = rnorm(n = T, mean = 0, sd = sigma.eps)

# equation for optimal prices
p = (a0 + eps)/(2*b)  + c / 2

# demand function
q = a0 + eps - b*p
```

## estimate demand slope with high eps

What do you think of those estimates? 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
lm(q~p) 
```

## we decrease again the epsilon
```{r,echo=TRUE}
T = 1000 # number of days
a0 = 100 # market size parameter
b = 1
c = runif(T,min = 10, max = 20)
  
sigma.eps = 0.0001 # standard deviation sigma of demand shocks
eps = rnorm(n = T, mean = 0, sd = sigma.eps)

# equation for optimal prices
p = (a0 + eps)/(2*b)  + c / 2

# demand function
q = a0 + eps - b*p
```

## re-estimate the model with low epsilon

What do you think now of our estimates? 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
lm(q~p) 
```

## Replace the $p$ by random values

```{r,echo=TRUE}
T = 1000 # number of days
a0 = 100 # market size parameter
b = 1
c = runif(T,min = 10, max = 20)
  
sigma.eps = 10 # standard deviation sigma of demand shocks
eps = rnorm(n = T, mean = 0, sd = sigma.eps)

# equation for optimal prices
#p = (a0 + eps)/(2*b)  + c / 2

# randomized p
p = runif(n=T,min = 30,max = 50)

# demand function
q = a0 + eps - b*p
```


## What do you think? 

Are we close to the true values? Justify why resp. why not. 

```{r,echo=TRUE}
lm(q ~ p)
```


## Reasoning Omitted Variable Bias

Prices are randomly drawn, i.e., independent of demand shock $\epsilon$ 

We do not have an omitted variable problem. 

- Omitted variable need to affect $p$ ***and*** $q$ to have a problem
- Similarly, no problem when we decrease the $\epsilon$ 

This reasoning is in line with our visual inspections of the demand function in the beginning. 

## Reduce number of observatins to T=10

```{r,echo=TRUE}
T = 10 # number of days
a0 = 100 # market size parameter
b = 1
c = runif(T,min = 10, max = 20)
  
sigma.eps = 10 # standard deviation sigma of demand shocks
eps = rnorm(n = T, mean = 0, sd = sigma.eps)

# equation for optimal prices
#p = (a0 + eps)/(2*b)  + c / 2

# randomized p
p = runif(n=T,min = 30,max = 50)

# demand function
q = a0 + eps - b*p
```


## Many observations = better estimates 

```{r,echo=TRUE}
lm(q ~ p)
```

The estimates seem to be closer to the true values when the number of observations is high. This is known as consistency.

## What have we done so far?

- **Policy Question:** We want to find a rule to set profit maximizing prices for Bob’s ice cream business.
- **Model for decision:** To find optimal prices, we need to know / estimate a demand function for ice cream.
- **Data:** We got a historical data set of prices and output. 
- **Findings:** Interestingly, prices are positively correlated with quantity sold.
  - Importantly, there are also random demand shocks $u$ (incorporating conditions like weather) that have been known by the price setter.
