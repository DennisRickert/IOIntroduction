# Licence

The licences for this repository follow those of Prof. Kranz:

 - Except for the RTutor problem sets, you can use all materials under a Creative Commmons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license license.

 - You can also use and share the RTutor problem sets similar to the (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license with one restriction: You are not allowed to use or share the problem sets if you make or plan to make publicly available or provide a link to any solutions of these problem sets. (To motivate students to solve the problem sets, they are grade-relevant to a small extend. Therefore I don't want solutions too easily available.)
