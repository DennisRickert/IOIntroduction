# Welcome and acknowledgement

Welcome to this online course on R and econometrics for industrial organisation! This course closely follows the work of Prof. Sebastian Kranz (Ulm University):

- Empirical Industrial Organisation and Consumer Choice: https://github.com/skranz/Empirical_IO_Course 
- Market analysis with econometrics and machine learning: https://github.com/skranz/MarketAnalysis

# Setting up R, Latex and Github

We are going to use R, Latex and GitHub for reproducible research! It is free. Please download and install:

- R (econometrics software): https://cran.r-project.org/
- RStudio (works with R and Latex): https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
- Latex (I use Texlive but any other distribution will do) : https://www.tug.org/texlive/
- Sign up for Github (for version control): https://github.com/ and download Github desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
- You can always use rstudio.cloud if you are struggling with installing R, Rstudio and Latex

# Licence

The licences for this repository follow those of Prof. Kranz:

 - Except for the RTutor problem sets, you can use all materials under a Creative Commmons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license license.

 - You can also use and share the RTutor problem sets similar to the (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license with one restriction: You are not allowed to use or share the problem sets if you make or plan to make publicly available or provide a link to any solutions of these problem sets. (To motivate students to solve the problem sets, they are grade-relevant to a small extend. Therefore I don't want solutions too easily available.)
