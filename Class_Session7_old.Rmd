## What we do in Session 7

- homogenous demand
- identification of conduct, 

Do a DiD?

- why do we have to estimate demand? 
- why do we have to infer collusion and not just look at prices?
  - when prices of two firms move together what looks like collusion might be correlation due to higher marginal costs 
  - retailers set their own prices which often softens downstream competition which may look like collusion 
  - just looking at how prices move together would not be causal 

## History of IO 

Early 20th century Agricultural Economics 

- How can we estimate demand and supply from data?
- Mostly homogeneous agricultural products
- Early discussion of simultaneity/endogeneity in econometrics

Complaint: everything assumed to be perfectly competitive

## Today: Game Theory revolution

Since 1980ies: Strategic decision making, Nash equilibrium

- Lots of intuitive and sometimes counter-intuitive clean theoretical models
- Hard to know which model is the right model for the industry we are looking at

Since 1990ies: New EIO
- joined with econometics, data, and computation 

## 

This session, we focus on homogeneous products

- Monopoly pricing

- Cournot Model (1883), Nash in quanities

- Bertrand-Nash pricing (boring case because of Bertrand paradox)

## Monopoly problem

Starting with a quantity-setting monopolist facing 

- a known inverse demand curve P(Q) 
- and costs C(Q)

$$\pi (Q) = P(Q)*Q-C(Q)-F$$
Take the FOC $\pi'(Q)=0$ and derive the Lerner Index 

$$\underbrace{\overbrace{P'(Q)*Q}^{Monopoly \\ Distortion}+P(Q)}_{MR}=\underbrace{C'(Q)}_{MC}$$
Without monopoly distortion, we are just at $P=MC$

## Marginal Revenue has two components

$MR=P'(Q)*Q + P(Q)$ 

- When I sell an extra unit, I am going to collect price $P$ on that unit
- When I am going to sell an extra unit, it is going to change the market clearing price $P'$
  - this change in market clearing price is going to be applied to all infra-marginal units $Q$

P'(Q) is negative, monopolist restricts output in order to collect a higher price. Monopoly prices given by

$$p=MC+P'(Q)Q$$

## Lerner Index in Monopoly

We take the optimality condition: 
$$P'(Q)*Q+P(Q)=C'(Q)$$
Rearrange and divide by P(Q): 

$$\frac{P(Q)-C'(Q)}{P(Q)}=-\frac{P'(Q)*Q}{P(Q)}\equiv \frac{1}{|\epsilon_D|}$$
Neat: infer monopoly markup from estimating elasticity $\epsilon_D$ 

- usually $|\epsilon_D|>1$ 
- easier / more reliable than obtaining informatin on marginal costs, marginal revenues,  and/or profits 

## Cournot Model / Nash in quantities

Assume constant marginal costs $c_i=c$ and $n$ equal sized firms. Let $Q=\sum_{i=1}^{N}q_i$ be the total output in the industry

We consider profits $\pi_i(q_i) = (P(Q)-C_i(q_i))\cdot q_i$ with FOC

$$\frac{\partial \pi_i(q_i)}{q_i}=(P(Q)-C'(q_i))+q_i \cdot P'(Q) \cdot \frac{\partial Q}{\partial q_i} = 0$$

Cournot competition implies $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial q_i}=1$ and $\frac{\partial q_j}{\partial q_i}=0$ for $i \neq j$

- the quantity of my competitors $q_j$ do not react to my change of output $q_i$ because it is a simultaneous move game
- when I produce 1 more unit, total output increases by 1 unit
  - My opponent cannot react to me producing 1 more unit

## Cournot optimality and Lerner Index

Under symmetry, all firms produce equal quantities $q_i=\frac{Q}{n}$

$$\underbrace{\overbrace{P'(Q)*\frac{Q}{N}}^{Cournot \\ Distortion}+P(Q)}_{MR}=\underbrace{C'(Q)}_{MC}$$

- in Monopoly, we had the same thing with $n=1$

Rearrange to form Lerner Index

$$\frac{P-mc}{P}=-\frac{1}{N}\frac{Q}{P}P'(Q)=-\frac{1}{N \cdot \epsilon_D}$$

## Conjectural Variation against complaint

... about Cournot: If I change my quantity, why doesn't my rival? 

Assume competitors react in $q$, then $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial q_i}=1+\frac{\partial Q_{-i}}{\partial q_i}$ 

Marginal Revenue becomes: $P(Q)+P'(Q) \cdot q_i \cdot (\underbrace{1+\frac{\partial Q_{-i}}{\partial q_i}}_{Conduct~\theta_i})$

- $\frac{\partial Q_{-i}}{\partial q_i}= -1$: Perfect competition (no change of aggregate Q ) 
- $\frac{\partial Q_{-i}}{\partial q_i}= 0$: Cournot with simultaneous moves
- $\frac{\partial Q_{-i}}{\partial q_i}= N-1$: Collusion (increase by $N$ if I increase by 1)

$\theta_i$ conjecture (=belief) about how my rival is going to respond

## 
We know that this relation holds in optimum: 

$$P(Q)+P'(Q) \cdot q_i \cdot (\underbrace{1+\frac{\partial Q_{-i}}{\partial q_i}}_{Conduct~\theta_i})= C'(Q)$$

We need to specify a demand function, an optimal pricing rule, and a marginal cost function

## 

We can rewrite the above expression byand multiply by $\frac{Q}{Q}$ to get

$$P(Q)+P'(Q) \cdot Q  \underbrace{\frac{q_i}{Q} \cdot (1+\frac{\partial Q_{-i}}{\partial q_i}}_{Normalized~Conduct~\phi_i})= C'(Q)$$
where conduct is weigthted by market share and thus lies between 0 and 1. 

- with symmetry: $\frac{q_i}{Q}=\frac{1}{N}$

The conduct parameter can take the following values:

- $\phi  = 0$ for perfect competition
- $0 < \phi < 1$ for oligopoly
- $\phi = 1$ for monopoly or collusion

## 
If we have access to information about costs, conduct parameter $\theta$ can be expressed in the following way:
$$ \theta  = − \gamma \frac{P-c}{P} \equiv L_{\eta}$$

where $\theta(P)$ is the elasticity of demand and $L_{\eta}$ is the adjusted Lerner index, i.e. Lerner index adjusted for elasticity (Genesove and Mullin, 1998).

We can thus estimate conduct using information on costs and elasticities

## Example: Bettendorf & Verboven

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("BV_abstract.jpg")
```

## Bettendorf & Verboven: Prices

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("BV_prices.jpg")
```

is this price gap due to collusion? 



## Identification of conduct

- Our task is to investigate competition in Dutch coffee market.
- Time-series monthly data contains information about the Dutch coffee market during the period 1990-1996 
- (more information in Bettendorf and Verboven (1998)).

## The data 

... includes the following variables

- month: year and month of observation;
- qu: per capita consumption of roasted coffee in kg;
- cprice: price of roasted coffee per kg in current guilders;
- tprice: price of per kg tea in current guilders;
- oprice: price index for other goods;
- incom: income per capita in current quilders;
- q1-q4: dummy variables for seasons 1 to 4;
- bprice: price of coffee beans per kg in current guilders;
- wprice: price of labor per man hours (work 160 hours per month).

## Empirical model - log linear demand

Market demand is assumed to take the following form:

$$Q_T = \beta(\alpha − P_t )\gamma + \varepsilon_t$$
assuming that $\alpha = 0$ and $\gamma < 0$ we have a log-linear demand function:

$$ln(Q_t) = ln(−\beta) + \gamma ln(P_t) + \varepsilon_t$$

where $Q_t$ is total is total output in the market and $P_t$ is the market price, and \varepsilon_t is the error term. 


##  Refresher: elasticities in different demand models

| Model     | Demand                                  | Transformed demand                        | Own-price elasticity          | 
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Linear    | $Q = \alpha + \beta P + \gamma X$       | $Q = \alpha + \beta P + \gamma X$         | $\varepsilon = \beta ∗ P/Q$   |
| Semi-log  | $Q = exp(\alpha + \beta P + \gamma X)$  | $lnQ = \alpha + \beta P + \gamma X$       | $\varepsilon = \beta ∗ P$     |
| Log-log   | $Q = exp(\alpha)P \beta X\gamma$        | $lnQ = \alpha + \beta lnP + \gamma ln X$  | $\varepsilon = \beta$         |
 
## Production technology

The coffee market is characterized by a relatively simple production technology with constant marginal cost:

$$c = c_0 + k P_{coffeebeans}$$ 

where $c_0$ represents all variable costs other than those related to coffee beans, i.e., labour and packages; and $k$ is a parameter that measures the fixed technology in production. It is estimated that one kg of roasted coffee requires 1.19 kg of beans. The $c_0$ is estimated to be around 4 guilders. 
  
## Solving for the conduct parameter


## Prices, costs and the conduct parameter

The market price can be written as a function of the conduct parameter $\theta$, the estimated demand, and cost parameters:

$$P(c) = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma + \theta} c$$

where $\gamma$ is the estimated demand elasticity in log-linear demand specification

## 

Obtaining $\theta$ from our coefficient on cost (b)

Rearranging:

$$b=\frac{\gamma}{\gamma + \theta}$$

$$\gamma=b(\gamma + \theta)$$

$$b\theta = \gamma − b\gamma $$


$$\theta = \frac{\gamma(1 − b)}{b}$$

## Our task

- Analyse data by computing simple statistics and provide graphical illustration.
- Estimate demand for roasted coffee using reasonable explanatory variables and instrumental variables.
- Explain what allows for identification of conduct in this model.
- Estimate Lerner index adjusted for elasticity and conduct parameter, and provide interpretation.

## Critique 

so we hold supply fixed and move around the demand curve (shocks). 

given that supply is fixed, we can draw supply curve at different points when demand changes

but we need to assume that conduct is fixed (e.g., collusion) which is a difficult assumption (Corts critique) 

- collusive conduct could be difficult to sustain with higher demand shocks (Corts critique)
